Basic flow of working on the contents

## Adding/Editing Contents

1. Fork <https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/extra> perhaps naming your fork "power-automation-extra" as an example
1. `git clone https://github.com/<yourid>/power-automation-extra.git`
1. `cd power-automation-extra`
1. `pip install mkdocs`
1. `mkdocs serve` - this will start the live-reloading docs server on port 8000, ctrl-c to stop
1. edit docs under the `./docs` subdir with your favorite editor (1 sentence per line)
1. point your browser to <http://localhost:8000>
1. repeat the edit & check until you are happy
1. `git add` your changes
1. `git commit -s` with good comment
1. `git push` to your forked repo
1. Create a PR against upstream `master` branch

## Reviewing Changes

1. New (pre-merge) PR submitted by somebody (eg. "pull/27")
1. Let's say you are in the `power-automation-extra` directory where `origin` points to your repo
1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/extra.git` (if you have not done this already)
1. `git fetch upstream pull/27/head:review` - this creates a remote branch called "review" in your repo with the PR
1. `git checkout review` - this downloads the source tree with the PR
1. `mkdocs serve`
1. point your browser to <http://localhost:8000>
